# Synchronous and Asynchronous JavaScript

## Synchronous JavaScript
- Executes code line by line, one at a time.
- Each line waits for the previous one to finish before executing.
- This can make the code easier to follow but can be slow if a line takes a long time to execute.
- Example: A loop that counts to a million will block the rest of the code until it's done.

## Asynchronous JavaScript
- Allows some code to run while waiting for other code to finish.
- Uses callbacks, promises, or async/await to handle tasks that take time, like fetching data from the internet.
- Helps keep the program responsive by not blocking other operations.
- Example: Fetching data from a server. You can continue to run other code while waiting for the data to come back.

## In Summary
- **Synchronous**: Code runs one after another, blocking until each task completes.
- **Asynchronous**: Code runs without blocking, allowing other tasks to execute while waiting.

## Example
Let's say we have 3 tasks and each task takes the following minutes to be executed:
- Task 1: 10 minutes
- Task 2: 15 minutes
- Task 3: 5 minutes

### Synchronous Execution
If the tasks are executed synchronously, it will take a total of **30 minutes** for all tasks to be completed.

### Asynchronous Execution
If the tasks are executed asynchronously, it will take a total of **15 minutes** for all tasks to be completed.
