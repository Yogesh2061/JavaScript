Concurrency, Parallelism, and Throttling in JavaScript

Concurrency
Concurrency in JavaScript refers to the ability of the engine to handle multiple tasks at the same time. JavaScript achieves concurrency through its event loop, which allows it to perform non-blocking operations. This is particularly useful for I/O operations like network requests and file reading.

Parallelism
Parallelism involves executing multiple operations simultaneously. While JavaScript is single-threaded by nature (due to the single-threaded model of the browser), it can achieve parallelism using Web Workers or Worker Threads in Node.js. These allow you to run scripts in background threads, enabling parallel execution of code.

Throttling
Throttling is a technique used to limit the frequency at which a function is executed. It's commonly used in scenarios where a function might be called repeatedly in quick succession, such as during window resizing or scrolling. Throttling ensures that the function is called at most once in a specified time period, improving performance and reducing resource consumption.
