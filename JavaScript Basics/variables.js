//variables and constants
//var const and let.

//variable and constants are of course used to store data but variables data can be changed but constants doesnot.

//Example:
//we can do this:
var a=20;
var a=30;
console.log(a)
//but we cannot do this coz const value should not be changed.
const b=20;
// const b=30; //we cannot reassingn the value of const.
console.log(b);

//we have another variable named let that is mostly used.
